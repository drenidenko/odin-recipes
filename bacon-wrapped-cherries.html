    <h2>Delicious Recipe for appetizers</h2>
    <p>This recipe for bacon-wrapped cherries makes one of my favorite appetizers. I say it serves 18 people, but if no one stops me, I will eat the whole batch myself and start making more.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>36 maraschino cherries, stemmed, drained and juice reserved</li>
        <li>18 slices bacon slices, halved</li>
        <li>36 toothpicks</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
        <li>Wrap each cherry with a bacon half, secure with a toothpick, and arrange on a baking sheet. Drizzle reserved cherry juice over wrapped cherries.</li>
        <li>Broil in the preheated oven until bacon is crisped to your liking, 3 to 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
